# TutorEase User Guide

TutorEase is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorEase can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TutorEase.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tutorease.jar`
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `contact list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `contact add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 r/Student t/friends t/owesMoney`:
      Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `contact delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `contact add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `contact add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Prefixes is not case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. if command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `N/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is also acceptable.

* Commands is not case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. if command is `contact add`, `CONTact ADd` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous TutorEase home folder.

**Q**: What languages are supported for inputs?<br>
**A**: Currently only english inputs are supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard
   shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy
   is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
