# TutorEase User Guide

TutorEase is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TutorEase.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tutorease.jar`
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `contact list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `contact add /n John Doe /p 98765432 /e johnd@example.com /a John street, block 123, #01-01 /r Student /tfriends`:
      Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `contact delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `contact add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `contact add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Prefixes is not case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. if command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `N/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is also acceptable.

* Commands is not case-sensitive. <br>
  e.g. if command is `contact add`, `CONTact ADd` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty
data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside
the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard
   shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy
   is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
